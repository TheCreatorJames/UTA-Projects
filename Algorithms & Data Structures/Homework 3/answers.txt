Recursive Formula for Task 1: 

[Technically, I'd say T(N) = 0, where N <= 1, but I wasn't sure if that'd be a legal base case]

T(0) = 0,
T(1) = 0,
T(N) = T(N-2) + C

This function decrements and increments in a very linear fashion. C is the expense of the function, the -2 is from it swapping the first and last characters, 
thus not needing to care about the last character in the next iteration.
